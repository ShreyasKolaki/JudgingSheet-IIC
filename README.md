# 🏆 Judging Dashboard & Leaderboard System

**🌐 Live Demo:** [https://judgeboard.aura-registration-portal.workers.dev](https://judgeboard.aura-registration-portal.workers.dev)

A Full Stack Judging Dashboard System designed for events like Hackathons, Ideathons, and RoboWars. This system replaces traditional spreadsheet-based judging with a real-time, automated, role-based evaluation system.

## 📌 Overview

The Judging Dashboard allows:
- **Judges** to enter scores seamlessly.
- **Admins** to control evaluation logic and criteria.
- **Teams** to track their performance.
- **System** to generate an automatic leaderboard with priority-based tie-breaking.

## 🎯 Core Problem Solved

Traditional judging systems suffer from manual calculation errors, lack of a real-time leaderboard, difficult comparison between teams, and lack of transparency. This system solves all of these using automation and structured evaluation.

## 👥 User Roles

### 1️⃣ Admin
- Controls the entire judging system.
- **Responsibilities:** Create/manage events, define judging criteria (0–10 range), assign priority/order (tie-breaker logic), assign weights to criteria, update judging structure, and view the leaderboard.
- **Special Logic:** Priority-based tie-breaking (see Scoring Logic).

### 2️⃣ Judge
- Logs in per event (e.g., Hackathon Judge, Ideathon Judge).
- **Responsibilities:** Select event, select team, enter scores for each criterion (0–10), and submit scores.
- Cannot modify criteria; works based on admin-defined structure. Data updates the leaderboard instantly.

### 3️⃣ Team Leader
- Login credentials linked to team data.
- **Responsibilities:** View their team’s scores and leaderboard, compare rankings.
- **Restrictions:** Read-only access; cannot edit anything.

## 🧮 Scoring Logic & Calculation

**Criteria Example:**
- Innovation (0–10)
- Technical Implementation (0–10)
- Feasibility (0–10)
- Presentation (0–10)
- Impact (0–10)

**Calculation:**
`Total Score = Sum (or Weighted Sum) of all criteria`

**Tie-Breaking (Priority Logic):**
If two teams have the same total score:
1. Compare the highest priority criterion.
2. The team with a higher score in that criterion wins.
3. If still tied → move to the next priority criterion.
4. If everything matches → same rank.

## ⚙️ System Flow

1. Admin logs in to create an event, define criteria, and assign priorities/weights.
2. Judges log in, select the event, and enter scores for teams.
3. Scores are stored in MongoDB.
4. FastAPI backend calculates totals and applies priority logic automatically.
5. Leaderboard updates in real-time.
6. All roles can view the sorted leaderboard.
